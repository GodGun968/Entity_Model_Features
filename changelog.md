0.2.7

- fixed all remaining base Fresh animations issues, **yes ***ALL*** of them**, *(the addons are still broken as are .jpms)*
- fixed several positional issues with models in general, almost every default generated model from blockbench matches exactly in game
- fixed flickering in pause menu for animations that factor in tick delta
- fixed texture size issues plaguing wardens and guardians in their blockbench default models
- added wither and ender dragon support, *(ender dragon doesn't support custom animations yet and when they do they will be limited)*

0.2.6

- fixed an issue with the head_yaw constraint fix in 0.2.5
- ensured floating point value consistency across all animation expression code
- fixed a IncompatibleClassChangeError crash with EMF when loading forge with unrelated mod dependency issues
- fixed a model creation crash
- improved non animated horse and ravager head model positioning, fixed horse saddle positioning, horse chests still broken
- added translations fr_fr, de_de, & el_gr


0.2.5

- fixed random models only changing the animations correctly not the models themselves
- fixed head_yaw not constraining to 360 degrees in some cases *(the cause of some weirdness in my animated player model)*
- added code to redirect modded entities for their own jem loading to be implemented in future *(this should fix crashes caused by modded mobs like "player_companions:pig" as emf used to think it was a regular pig )*
- fixed mod compatibility flags to prevent users loading EMF alongside OptiFabric or CEM as this is not supported
